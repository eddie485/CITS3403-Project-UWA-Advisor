                        <div class="caro-text first-slide-spacer" style="font-size:0.98vw;">
                            <p> If at any point during your degree you wish to change your major, log into your studentconnect and change the unit set of the major(s) that you are currently enrolled into the major that you wish to change to. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Please keep in mind that changing your major may extend the duration of your degree according to the units that you have already undertaken and have to undertake. </li>
                                <li> Many first-year units in degrees such as the Bachelor of Biomedical Science are shared and changing major will often have no consequence, however this is often and not always the case, especially if you are also changing your degree to another field of study. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> If you wish to change your course as an undergraduate student, you have two transfer “windows” per year to transfer to another eligible undergraduate course (if you meet the prerequisites for that course). This application is easy to complete and is available online via studentconnect. </p>
                            <p> If you wish to speak to someone if you are considering changing course, you may contact your Student Advising Office (specific for each faculty, you can find your SAO when you login to studentconnect online) or speak to a Careers Advisor (appointments can be made through the Careers Centre (careers.uwa.edu.au) </p>

                            <p> If a certain major that you are undertaking changes the degrees in its course structure, either by removing them entirely or changing a prerequisite for that major, you are able to contact your degree’s faculty office at UWA (e.g. School of Science for Bachelor of Science) and ask them to keep you enrolled in the course in the year that you first began the major. </p> <br>

                                <li> For example, if I began my degree majoring in Data Science as my degree-specific major in 2019, and I have undertaken units that are now removed from the course, I have the option of continuing the course as it was in 2019 or 2020.</li>
                                <li> Keep in mind that you must consult with your student office (e.g. Faculty of Science) to put this into effect. </li>

                                <li><span class="def-text"> Majors</span>: A major is a structured sequence of units in a particular discipline or field of study. It provides you with the opportunity to develop the knowledge, understanding and expertise that will equip you to move into a rewarding career after graduation or to pursue further study in a similar area at postgraduate level. You can choose a degree-specific major and a second major if you wish.  </li>
                                <li><span class="def-text"> Minors</span>: Minors are smaller unit sets that are composed of four units that you can optionally include as part of your course. These are much like majors, however they are much shorter. </li>
                                <li><span class="def-text"> Core Units</span>: Core units are the compulsory units in your major. Some majors are made up entirely of core units whereas others allow you to choose from a selection of options. The core units that you must do also depend on whether that major is your course-specific major or your second major. </li>

                                <li><span class="def-text"> Complementary Units </span>: Some degree-specific majors require you to study complementary units that provide important additional knowledge and expertise in particular areas or allow you to fill gaps in your knowledge that will be required to successfully complete the major. Up to four complementary units may be specified, though many degree-specific majors have fewer, and some prescribe none. </li>
                                <li><span class="def-text"> Electives </span>: Units that provide you with the opportunity to explore a range of interests and new disciplines.
