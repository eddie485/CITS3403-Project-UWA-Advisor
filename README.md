# CITS3403-Project

Main project for Agile Web Development.

## About
UWA ADVISOR

The project will be about a website that helps UWA students with their enrolments and further studies at the University. The website has a contents page which explains the rules and terms that they must follow when 
enrolling at the University of Western Australia. It explains concepts such as undergraduate enrolment, postgrad
enrolment, what to do if a unit changes its course outline as well as other definitions that new students should be familiar with when starting off at uni. Alongside the contents page there are also quizes to help ensure that they have a good understanding of everything they learnt previously. A mock study plan is also available which lets users create a study plan for their first three years of undergrad. For now the only majors available in the study plan are Finance and Data Science, within these majors their core units can be selected and added into the study plan.
